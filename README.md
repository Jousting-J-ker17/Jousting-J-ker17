- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joe Kuhn aka @Jousting-J-ker17, a junior software developer seeking opportunities to develop my Java, and Python skills 

- Over the past few months, I've been studying Full-Stack Development and recieving certifications as an IT Specialist for Java, Python, JavaScript, databases, and HTML5 application development. 

- About me: I attended Syracuse University where I studied Economics and served in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree and was proudly commissioned into the U.S. Army in 2013. As a Field Artillery Officer, I served in Oklahoma and Hawaii with training stints across the nation. Unfortunately, I was medically retired as a Captain (O-3) after an injury. I always intended to serve for a career, but my injury forced me to re-evaluate.
  After spending a few years working in the project management side of technology and at operations in finance, I was fortunate to take some time off to tend to my health. I am now pursing a job in software development where I can use my leadership skills and new technical skills to find meaningful opportunities.
  
- I'm always interested in learning new skills and working with teams to make the world a better place.
